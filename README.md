### What are we doing?

To support the **Connect to a data source** activity in the module, How to build an app solution, the sample file Contoso-Site-Tracking.zip is required. We are publishing this file on GitHub to facilitate downloading the zip file. 

### How should this file be used?

1. Download the Contoso-Site-Tracking.zip file, extract all of the files, and save them to your OneDrive for Business.
2. Return to step 3 in the **Connect to a data source** unit to proceed with the remaining steps in the activity.
